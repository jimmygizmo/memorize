I will be customizing code and code comments per my own methodologies and interests and so may deviate from the coursework. Some of my interest areas include using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with IOS apps to control custom electronics projects. I am also interested in communicating with a cloud-based REST backend for all applications, featuring user login, preference and account maintenance and other common application needs, so my work in this repo my also include some of these elements mixed in with the CS 193P material from the video series. We'll see.
