App will scan for nearby iBeacons. Uses object binding.

* Tutorial is a bit old now (2 yrs+) and one system object has changed. It is part of Combine.
BindableObject is now ObservableObject.
Remains TBD to see if usage has changed and what all needs to be done to get working code.
I don't expect it to take too much to adapt to any changes to Swift/SwiftUI/Foundation  etc.
