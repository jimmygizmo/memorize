App will scan for nearby iBeacons. Uses object binding.

* Tutorial is a bit old now (2 yrs+) and one system object has changed. It is part of Combine.
BindableObject is now ObservableObject.
See code comments for 3 small changes needed to operate under swift 5.5 with the new ObservableObject.
Works great.
