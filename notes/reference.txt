Apple Developer Site - Swift Language Reference Entry for: Optional
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional

TODO: Figure out what documentation is on Swift.org and what is on Developer.Apple. Since Swift is Open Source,
obviously Apple's implementation will have some (probably slight) differences. This is important to learn.
The Stanford CS193P course has so far only referred to swift.org and not mentioned any differneces.

UPDATE!!! The above link is to a page SHOWING UPCOMING CHANGES TO THE API BETWEEN XCODE 12.5 AND BETA 13.

OK. So this obvliously means there is higher potential for differences bewtwwen Apple's Swift and the Open Source flavor.
More learning on this is clearly warranted. (*Good to see them evoloving the language rapidly. This is mentioned elsewhere.)
