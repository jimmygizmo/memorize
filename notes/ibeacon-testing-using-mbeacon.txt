This article includes how to simulate ibeacons from a mac:

Links to this tool on GitHub which also installs via brew:
https://github.com/watr/mbeacon

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY ON THE GITUB PAGE.

Install is simple:
brew tap watr/formulae
brew install mbeacon

Be sure to give permission to Terminal.app and/or iTerm.app or whatever you use for console to run mbeacon.
IT MUST BE GIVEN BLUETOOTH PERMISSION IN SYSTEM PREFERENCES.
NOTE: You might need this for your IDE if you run it from the terminal there.

If you don't have permission, you will get a very minimal process Abort message with no details, like this:
➜  ~ mbeacon -major 123 -minor 456
[1]    43198 abort      mbeacon -major 123 -minor 456
- - - - - - - -

GIVE YOUR TERMINAL PERMISSION TO USE BLUETOOTH:
System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> TAB: Privacy -> Left Panel: Bluetooth -> Main Panel (+) PLUS - Add App
Add your Terminal.app, iTerm.app or IDE etc.


Before using, you also must FIRST set the UUID, MAJOR and MINOR ids like this:
$ defaults write mbeacon uuid -string "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
$ defaults write mbeacon measuredPower -integer -45

And then use it like this:
$ mbeacon -major 123 -minor 456

MY RESULTS:
--------------------

Apparently running correctly after having been given permission:

➜  ~ mbeacon -major 123 -minor 456
uuid: 5A4BCFCE-174E-4BAC-A814-092E77F6B7E5, major: 123, minor: 456, measuredPower: -45

----------------------

TESTING SUCCESSFUL.
Was able to detect this beacon and it's distance, turn it on and off and see the corresponding effect.
This is a nice tool to have, but I will start testing with some real Apple iBeacons shortly.

--------------------------

I suspect that some adjustment might need to be made to the value for measuredPower.
I get all three zones: immediate, near, far and unknown .. but the occur VERY close to the laptop running
mbeacon to simulate the ibeacon. I think the simulation needs more power.
I will research what Apple intends the open-air/low-noise distance ranges to be, then see if I can adjust the
measuredPower value to get something that matches.
I'm not sure if the BLE antennae are in the base or in the lid of the macbook pro, but anyhow, my lid is open at about 90 degrees.
Will update here when I might be able to get to doing this calibration after the research.
