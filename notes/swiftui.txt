Misc SwiftUI notes
------------------


                // TODO: CONFIRM: It looks like ZStack is painting the components from bottom to top,
                // meaning from the device to the user, while the code itself is the opposite, from
                // top to bottom.

-----------------------
Assign vs. pass as argument for vars inside a View:

struct CardView: View {
    var isFaceUp: Bool
//    var isFaceUp: Bool { return false }  // This is how we would assign/hardcode a value here.
// Since we do not set a vale above, this becomes like a required argument to CardView() since it
// must have a value set by assignment or evaluation here or by passing as an argument.
