Well I restructured things so I initialized the first deck at app startup and passed stuff to the args for ContentView and thus I eliminated the init() from ContentView.
This definitely was good, since this init() could not set any game state anyhow since it gets called so much as the UI is repainted (I hope I am assuming all that correctly .. but I think so). Anyhow, I figured I had made all good changes and the bug wouod be gone, but no.

The bug is still here although it might behave a little differently now.

I slowed down. Tapping fast has nothing to do with it. Just picking an index that is too big, RANDOMLY .. is all it takes.
If you tap slowly and change decks on ANY button, it will eventually hit the bug VIA THE RANDOM NUMBER PICK.

But the issue still could be how @State/@Binding update. So we might still call it a sort of race condition, but not one that comes from tapping fast and a whole bunch of threads running amok etc.

This might be a design-related race condition. A bad design .. or a fundamental code logic bug.

I think I made an improvement with the init() change, but the main bug is still here. I just prevented it from showing up before the app could even launch. At least now it should always launch without ever hitting this bug. Before my init() change I think it could hit the bug even before the app showed the first view. Which it was clearly doing.
