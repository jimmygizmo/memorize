            // REGARDING FONT SIZES. TODO: Continue research to determine a long term
            // best practice for handling fonts for all iPhone and iPad devices. I would hope for
            // a techinique that eliminates all fixed sizes or at least abstracts and centralizes
            // any fixed-sizing issues or device/setting-detection needs. I don't think we should
            // ever see fixed sizes in app code. A simple standard is needed but I suspect that a
            // custom one is needed. I would like to just use specifiers that work for nearly all
            // parts of all apps. Such a scheme might look similar to:
            // .fontSizeButton, .fontSizeTitle, .fontSizeSettings, .fontSizeFormHead,
            // .fontSizeFormInput, .fontSizeSmall, .fontSizeHeading, .fontSizeContent
            //
            // I am imagining a scheme like this, managed centrally. It should be kept simple
            // and will need to manage a few different typefaces as well. Some logic for a few
            // device or setting edge cases might be needed. Bottom line is that once this
            // has been developed according to best practices, it should need little change to
            // be used for many different types of applications and should always appear in the
            // app code in the same defined/clean way.
