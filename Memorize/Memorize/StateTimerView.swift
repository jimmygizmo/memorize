// I found this tutorial to be interesting and relevant. I especially noticed how he used
// A very small amount of code to set up an async timer to update a view and I've thought
// of some things I will need functionality like this for. Found this tutorial during my
// research of @Published, ObservableObject and ObservedObject. NOTE: This tut is older and
// refers to @ObjectBinding etc. but the new terminology uses 'Observable' not 'Binding' etc.

// SwiftUI Tutorial: What's the difference between @State, @ObjectBinding, and @EnvironmentObject?
